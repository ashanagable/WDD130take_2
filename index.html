<p> I am currently working towards a degree in Cybersecurity. My favorite things to do are reading, playing soccer, hiking, and camping. 
    I hope to learn how to build better code for the future and gain career opportunities by having a background in CSS and HTML. 
    I have been a member for about five years.
